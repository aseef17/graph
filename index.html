    Why do you need to use charts, graphs, and diagrams

    A lot of presentations are focused on data and numbers. Sounds boring, right? Apart from essential <a
      href="https://preply.com/en/blog/50-essential-business-presentation-phrases-for-better-performance/">business
      presentation phrases</a>, charts, graphs, and diagrams can also help you draw and keep your listeners' attention.
    Add them to your presentation, and you will have profound evidence-based work.

    When presenting and explaining data charts, graphs, and diagrams, you should help people understand and memorize at
    least their main points<a href="https://www.ilc.cuhk.edu.hk/files/ChartsGraphs_Gilhooly.pdf">data charts, graphs,
      and diagrams</a>, and you should help people understand and memorize at least the main points from them. As to the
    use cases, diagrams and other visuals are perfectly fit for describing trends, making a comparison, or showing
    relationships between two or more items. In other words, you take your data and give it a visually comprehensible
    form.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are so many different types of charts, diagrams, and graphs that it becomes difficult to choose the right one.
    The chart options in your spreadsheet program can also greatly puzzle.
  </p>
  <p>
    When should you use a flow chart? Can you apply a diagram to present a trend? Is a bar chart useful for showing
    sales data? To figure out what to select, you must have a good understanding of the specific features of each type.

  <p>
    The rest of this article will show examples of different types of presentation visuals and explain in detail how to
    describe charts and diagrams.

      Data can be represented in many ways. The 4 main types of graphs are a bar graph or bar chart, line graph, pie
      chart, and diagram

        <strong class="underline-text">Bar graphs</strong> are used to show relationships between different data series
        that are independent of each other. In this case, the height or length of the bar indicates the measured value
        or
        frequency. Below, you can see the example of a bar graph which is the most widespread visual for presenting
        statistical data.

        is especially useful when you want to demonstrate trends or numbers that are connected. For example, how sales

        particular period.

        Once you create a fascinating graph for your presentation, it is time to know how to describe graphs, charts,
        and diagrams. To catch your audience's attention from the very beginning, you can use the following phrases for
        the introduction: Let me show you this bar graph…
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Let's turn to this diagram…</li>
        <li>I'd like you to look at this map…</li>
        <li>If you look at this graph, you will notice…</li>
        <li>Let's have a look at this pie chart…</li>
        <li>If you look at this line chart, you will understand…</li>
        <li>To illustrate my point, let's look at some charts…</li>

      How to describe bar graphs

    <div>
      <p>
        Bar graphs transform the data into separate bars or columns. Generally, this type of visuals have categories on
        the x-axis and the numbers on the y-axis. So, you can compare statistical data between different groups.
      </p>
      <p>The bar graphs show which category is the largest and which is the smallest one. Each group should be
        independent so that the changes in one do not influence others. The bars or columns can be drawn either
        vertically or horizontally, as it doesn’t make any difference.</p>
